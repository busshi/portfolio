## My passion: cybersecurity

For a very long time, I have been very curious to know how it is possible to divert the normal use of objects. For example, how to turn a light bulb into an alarm or into a notification alarm, how to broadcast messages on a television not intended for this use. I am passionate about these kinds of personal projects and have spent a lot of free time doing them. Since I knew how to code, I mixed my home automation and programming skills to create all kinds of scripts and applications to automate common tasks. 

Passionate about home automation, I deploy services from my home. The security of my equipments and the confidentiality are very importants. It is therefore not possible to open a service on the external network without first taking the necessary security measures to prevent vulnerabilities and avoid intrusion attempts.

## Self-training

To stay abreast of common vulnerabilities and exploits, I signed up for several online learning platforms, such as [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.com) or [RootMe](https://root-me.org), for example. In order to better understand vulnerabilities, I decided to create my own CTF [Capture The Flag] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag) challenges. Some challenges are also available on [this site](https://42ctf.org). So I perfect myself on the different branchs of security.

## Capture The Flag

There are many online competitions organized in which I regularly participate: CTF. These events that last several days and nights are very enriching because it is about new challenges and the time is limited which forces you to surpass yourself over time. Beware of sleepless nights!

## My first certification: eJPT

Having decided to retrain professionally to make my passion my job, I had to pass a certification to show my employers that I was ready to work in this field. So I signed up for this certification that I successfully passed the same day, without really any difficulty. Next step: [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/).

## What I learned from this project

I now master many pentest tools, most of which are on Kali Linux distributions. By regularly using debugging tools, disassemblers, different scripts to exploit vulnerabilities, I know how to quickly identify which tool to use to test the different environments. It can be a website, an application, a network, a computer, a printer... Cybersecurity is a huge world to explore! Keep on learning.

# MY PORTFOLIO

Web single page application coded in Typescript using NextJS framework. This app is my portfolio and I explain here some of my personal projects.

### Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/busshi/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

On every push to master branch, the project is build and pushed to (Dockerhub)[https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/busshi] using CircleCI. It is also deployed online.
